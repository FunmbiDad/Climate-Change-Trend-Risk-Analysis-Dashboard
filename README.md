# Climate-Change-Trend-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard

## Executive Summary

Climate change is no longer a future concern—it is a present-day risk affecting infrastructure, businesses, public safety, and economic stability.
This project analyzes long-term climate data to uncover relationships between **temperature anomalies, rainfall patterns, CO₂ emissions, sea-level rise, forest cover, and extreme weather events**.

The analysis transforms raw climate data into **actionable insights** that support impact-based decision-making, climate risk assessment, and early warning system design. The dashboard highlights key trends, correlations, and vulnerable regions, enabling stakeholders to move from awareness to prevention.

## Business Problem

Organizations and governments face increasing losses from climate-related disasters, yet many decisions are still based on:

* Historical climate averages
* Isolated weather metrics
* Reactive disaster response strategies

**Key challenges addressed:**

* Lack of data-driven climate risk visibility
* Poor linkage between weather forecasts and real-world impact
* Underestimation of extreme weather and long-term climate risks
* Inefficient climate adaptation and mitigation investments

---

## Business Requirements

To effectively address climate risk, decision-makers need:

* A consolidated view of climate indicators and trends
* Clear identification of high-risk countries and regions
* Evidence-based relationships between climate variables
* Insights that support real-time forecasting and long-term planning
* A scalable framework for predictive and impact-based analysis

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**

   * Historical climate data covering rainfall, temperature, CO₂ emissions, sea-level rise, forest cover, and extreme weather events.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

   * Standardized units and formats
   * Handled missing values and inconsistencies
   * Aggregated data by country and year

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Trend analysis over time
   * Country-level comparisons
   * Identification of anomalies and variability patterns

4. **Correlation & Risk Analysis**

   * Assessed relationships between:

     * Rainfall & extreme weather events
     * Renewable energy & CO₂ emissions
     * Sea-level rise & extreme weather events
   * Identified vulnerable countries using multi-factor analysis

5. **Data Visualization**

   * Built an interactive dashboard to communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

## Results & Key Insights

* **Rising temperature anomalies strongly align with increased extreme weather events**
* **Rainfall variability**, not just volume, is a major driver of floods and disasters
* Renewable energy adoption alone does not guarantee reduced CO₂ emissions
* Sea-level rise is a slow but compounding risk, especially in low-forest coastal regions
* Forest cover plays a critical role in reducing climate vulnerability
* Impact-based insights provide more value than raw weather metrics
